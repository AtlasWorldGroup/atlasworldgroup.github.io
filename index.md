{% include JB/setup %}

The purpose of this site is to aid in documenting AtlasNet application standards.

## Files

To implement the AtlasNet standards for styling using Bootstrap, you will need our custom built `bootstrap.css` and `atlas-toolkit.css`.

~~~bash
Install-Package Atlas.Standard
~~~
NOTE: This NuGet package is still in development. Currently, it is only available for C#.

## Icons

We use `Font Awesome` for our icons. You can find information regarding this CSS toolkit at <a href="http://fontawesome.io" target="_blank">http://fontawesome.io</a>
